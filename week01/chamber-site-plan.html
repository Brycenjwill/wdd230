    <main>
        <div class="info">
        <p>Site Name: Kennett Square Chamber of commerce. This name represents the city of Kennett Square, where the chamber is located.</p>
        <p>Description: "The Kennett Square Chamber of Commerce is committed to serving the region as the leading force for our business community. The Chamber promotes trade, commerce, industry, and sustainable economic development."</p>

        <div class="style">
        <p>Typography: Arial will be used for the entirety of the website. This is because this site will be for government purposes and arial is one of the few court-approved legal document fonts for readability.</p>
        <p>Color scheme: My color scheme will be mostly greyed-greens, to fit the colors of the area without being too strong. The color #52796F will be used as the background for most main sections, with white as the main text color for those sections. #354F52 will be used for headers font, and for the background of navigation bars/menus. #2F3E46 is for the background of footers, with #CAD2C5 as the footer font color and a backup font color for where white doesn't fit. #2F3E46 is generally used where black font would not fit well. </p>
        <p>Wireframes: Desktop on the left. Mobile on right.</p>
